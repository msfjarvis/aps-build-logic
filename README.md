This repository serves as a store of Gradle [convention plugins] that align with the policies adopted by the [Android Password Store] project. It was filtered out of the canonical Git repository along with its commit history and will eventually become the singular source of truth after which the copy of this code that exists in [Android Password Store] will be removed.
